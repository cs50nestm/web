# Brick Breaker

The goal of this project is to code a Brick Breaker game, either on your own, or as a code-a-long with the videos. You may totally customize it, to make it your own. You can customize the size of the canvase, the colors, the number of bricks, create powerups, additional levels, or just about anything else you can imagine!

<style type="text/css">
.iframe_container {
	position: relative;
	padding-bottom: 56.25%; 
	padding-top: 25px;
	height: 0;
	margin-bottom: 30px;
}

.iframe_container iframe {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}
</style>

The final result could (but does not have to) look something like this:

<div class="iframe_container">

</div>

## What to Do

This problem will take several steps to complete. The videos below will guide you through this. I will, of course, be available as well to help explain and troubleshoot.

#### Part 1
```
1. Create a ball and paddls as JavaScript Objects
2. Create the functions `displayBall()`, `updateBall()`, `checkEdges()`, `displayPaddle()`, `paddleMove()`
```

Note: This video assumes you know something about JavaScript objects and arrays. The [mini-lesson linked here](https://cs50nestm.github.io/web/objects-and-arrays/) explains these concepts.

## Getting Started

You can start by copying one of the folders you've used before for a prior p5 project, or download the starter folder as outlined here.

1. Execute `cd` to ensure that youâ€™re in ~/ (i.e., your home directory, aka ~).
2. Execute `wget https://github.com/cs50nestm/web/raw/master/brick_breaker/p5_folder.zip` to download a (compressed) ZIP file with the p5 starter files.
1. Execute `unzip p5_folder.zip` to uncompress that file.
1. Execute ls. You should see a directory called `p5_folder`, which was inside of that ZIP file.
1. Rename this folder to `brick_breaker`.
1. Execute `cd brick_breaker` to change into that directory.
1. Execute ls. You should see the p5 starter code, including index.html, style.css and sketch.js
1. Feel free to use this p5 starter code for other p5 projects. If you leave the `p5_folder.zip` in your directory, you can unzip it again in the future to start another project.

## Next Step

If you didn't join the live classes where we developed brick breaker together, watch the videos on the Google Classroom site.

## Specification

1. Create the game, as per the videos, and add one personal feature, to make it your own.

## Rubric

1. **90%** Submit as shown in the class videos
1. **100%** Add one personal touch

## How to Submit

You will start in a similar way to the paddle and ball game we recently completed. The canvas in the video is vertical, with a width of 400 and a height of 600, however you can make it square or horizontal, of any dimension that fits on your screen. Eventually you will add an array of brick objects on top of the screen. We will then add a function to iterate thorugh this array of bricks to determine if the ball hits one of the bricks. When we get a ball-brick collision we remove the brick from the array of bricks and increase the score.

Finally, we added a game initialization function, that restarts the game by resetting the number of lives and the score and restores all the bricks.
