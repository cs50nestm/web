# Problem: CSS

## Getting Ready

## Make Your Web Page Look Cool!

To style webpages, weâ€™ll use another language, CSS, Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media and is a very important part of web design.

Consider joining Doug again, this time for a tour of CSS:

<style type="text/css">
.iframe_container {
	position: relative;
	padding-bottom: 56.25%; 
	padding-top: 25px;
	height: 0;
	margin-bottom: 30px;
}

.iframe_container iframe {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}
</style>

<div class="iframe_container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ub3FKU21ubk?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe>
</div>

## What You Can Do with CSS

There are lot more things you can do with CSS.

* You can easily apply same style rules on multiple elements.
* You can control the presentation of multiple pages of a website with a single style sheet.
* You can present the same page differently on different devices.
* You can style dynamic states of elements such as hover, focus, etc. that isn't possible otherwise.
* You can change the position of an element on a web page without changing the markup.
* You can alter the display of existing HTML elements.
* You can transform elements like scale, rotate, skew, etc. in 2D or 3D space.
* You can create animations and transitions effects without using any JavaScript.

## Where do I start?

Start by previewing the HTML program you just completed. Remember to preview a web page, type in:

```
http-server
```

into the terminal window, and then click on the `index.html` link and you can preview your page.

The page probably has a picture on it, and if it doesn't, please do add one. It may not be styled well so let's get to work! Now that you know `HTML` feel free to edit the text, and add a different picture instead.

You can use this file as a starting point. To do this, copy the contents of your `index.html` in your `html` folder, then go back to your `unit3` directory in your terminal and create a new `css`folder. Then `cd` into this new folder and create a new `index.html` file.

```
cd ..
mkdir css
cd css
code index.html
```

Then paste the code from your HTML project into your CSS project.

Let's start by centering the heading. There are many ways of doing this with `CSS`. You can add style attributes directly into your `HTML` tags, use a `<style>` element in the `<head>` section, or link an external `CSS` file that you link into the `<head>` section of your `HTML`. 

We'll add our `CSS` to the top of the `HTML` file on the right in between the `<style></style>` tags. If we want to center all `h1` heading tags, we can use this tag directly in our CSS as follows:

```css
<style>
  h1 {
    text-align: center;
  }
</style> 
```

Add this code into your `HTML` on the right and see what happens.

**Next**, let's fix the size of the image. Sizes of elements can be determined by pixels, or percentage of the web page (or as we'll soon see a div that it's contained in). Let's make this image exactly 300 pixels wide. If we don't give it a width, it will automatically be sized to a height that's proportional.

To do this add a unique identifier or `id` to the `<img>` tag for your image. If you chose to use the term "prudence" as your `id`, your code would look like this:

```html
<img id="prudence" src="prudence.png">
```

You of course may not be using an id or file name of prudence, so please do substitute an appropriate id and name of your image.

Then we could add the new width of our image into the `<style>` section on top:

```css
<style>
  h1 {
    text-align: center;
  }
  #prudence {
    width: 300px;
  }
</style> 
```

Notice we use a hashtag, `#` in front of the `id`, "prudence". This is called a `CSS Selector`. We use a `#` in front of an `id` in `CSS` to tell our program that we are refering to the element with an `id` of "prudence.

To keep the text and image from being so close to the left margin of our web page, we can wrap this in a `div` or a section of our `HTML` document, with a width of 80% of whatever width our browser is open to. Let's give this `div` a `class` named "continer" and style it with `CSS`. A class also identifies code in between it's open and close `HTML` tags, however unlike an `id` it's not necessarily unique. We use a dot in front of the class name (as in `.container`) to refer to a class in `CSS`.

So our `HTML` might now look something like this:

```html
<div class="container">
  <p>Prudence is a rescue dog we adopted three years ago.</p>
  <img id="prudence" alt="Prudence" src="prudence.png">
  <p>We adopted her from <a href="https://www.bideawee.org/">Bidawee</a>.</p>
</div>       
```

We can describe the width of this `div` in `CSS` as 80%. We can also center the entire `div` in our browswer page by using `margin: auto`. 

Inside the `<style></style>` tags and after the close brace styling the "prudence" `id`, add:

```css
.container {
  width: 80%;
  margin: auto;
}
```
## Now add your own CSS!

Feel free to browse around the `CSS` pages in [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) and continue to style your page with additional featuers such as different fonts, colors, and sizes of your elements. Feel free to experiment and have fun!
