# Comp Sci Final Project 2021

## tl;dr
Create a game, a website, an infographic or a presentation.

## Background
The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and use it to develop something really special.
For those who prefer learning more about current issues in computing, the option exists to research and create a presentation on a select topic as well. You may work alone, or in a breakout room with teams of up to four members.

## Choices
Here are the four different directions you can choose from:

1. **Game** or Interactive Animation in p5.js
	- **[Pong](https://intro.cs50nestm.net/pong/)** (continuing to build on the algorithms logic we developed for the paddle ball project)
	- **[Brick Breaker](https://intro.cs50nestm.net/brick_breaker/)** (begin to use JavaScript objects, arrays of objects, and integrate into HTML page)
	- **[Mario](https://intro.cs50nestm.net/mario)** (program the game mechanics as a code-a-long and develop your own game landscape using totally customized tile maps)
	- **[Flappy Bird, Snake or Space Invaders](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/115-snake-game-redux.html)** using Dan Shiffman's tutorials.

2. **Website** either as a inter-disciplinary project, or on an topic you are particularly passionate about and that helps make the world a better place.
3. Webpage with **[JavaScript infographics](https://intro.cs50nestm.net/virus)**, such as an interactive graphs or charts. This graph in this virus simulation uses [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html)  
4. Google Slides presentation on one of the following **impacts of computing**
	- **Beneficial and Harmful Effects:** While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.
	- **Digital Divide:** The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics and raises issues of equity, access, and influence.
	- **Computing Bias:** Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
	- **Crowdsourcing:** Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.
	- **Legal and Ethical Concerns:** Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use.
	- **Safe Computing:** The use of computing innovations may involve risks to personal safety and identity. This may involve risks to privacy and/or unauthorized access to computing resources.
