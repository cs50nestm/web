# Comp Sci Final Project 2022

## tl;dr
Create a game, a website or a presentation.

## Background
The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and use it to develop something really special.
For those who prefer learning more about current issues in computing, the option exists to research and create a presentation on a select topic as well. You may work alone, or with a team of up to four members.
Projects will be presented to the entire class in June.

## Choices
Here are the four different directions you can choose from:

1. **Game** or Interactive Animation in p5.js.  
*Note: if you do a game as a final project, you need to do only one game code-a-long, either Pong or Flappy.*
	- **[Breakout](https://cs50nestm.github.io/web/breakout2022/)** (extend the basic game with powerups, locked bricks, changing paddle size and more!)
	- **[Mario](https://cs50nestm.github.io/web/mario/)** (program the game mechanics as a code-a-long and develop your own game landscape using totally customized tile maps)
	- **[Flappy Bird, Snake or Space Invaders](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/115-snake-game-redux.html)** using Dan Shiffman's tutorials.
	- **Your own game** (Design by you and your team!)
	
2. **Website** either as a inter-disciplinary project, or on an topic you are particularly passionate about and that helps make the world a better place. Another possibility is to create a game portal and feature your versions of Pong and Flappy Bird, plus any other games (even Scratch) you've completed.
3. Google Slides presentation on one of the following **impacts of computing**
	- **Beneficial and Harmful Effects:** While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.
	- **Digital Divide:** The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics and raises issues of equity, access, and influence.
	- **Computing Bias:** Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
	- **Crowdsourcing:** Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.
	- **Legal and Ethical Concerns:** Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use.
	- **Safe Computing:** The use of computing innovations may involve risks to personal safety and identity. This may involve risks to privacy and/or unauthorized access to computing resources.
4. Research on a current issue in computer science, or technology in general. This would be presented as a google slide presentation as well, and must be cleared by me.
