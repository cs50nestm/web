# Flappy Bird

## tl;dr
Build a Flappy Bird game.

## Preview
Once the game is complete, it could look something like this. The game map is totally customizable and yours will most likely look quite a bit different.

<style type="text/css">
.iframe_container {
	position: relative;
	padding-bottom: 56.25%; 
	padding-top: 25px;
	height: 0;
	margin-bottom: 30px;
}

.iframe_container iframe {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}
</style>

## What to Do
This problem will take several steps to complete. The videos below will guide you through this. I will, of course, be available as well to help explain and troubleshoot.

#### Part 1 
	1. Creating the `generateTiles()` function
	2. Creating the `Sprite` class
	3. Creating the game map using a csv file

Note: This video assumes you know something about JavaScript objects and arrays. The [mini-lesson linked here](https://cs50nestm.github.io/web/objects-and-arrays/) explains these concepts.

## Getting Started
I highly recommend dowloading [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer&ssr=false#overview) installed on your own computer to develop and test your code.

1. Download this problem’s "distribution code" (i.e., starter code) onto your computer. Copy and paste `https://github.com/cs50nestm/web/raw/master/mario/mario.zip` into the address bar of your web browser to download a (compressed) ZIP file. 
2. Drag this zip file into a folder where you will develop your application, then open that folder in VS Studio.
5. Execute `unzip mario.zip` in the terminal you will have access to in VS Studio.
6. Execute `rm mario.zip` to delete that ZIP file.
7. Execute `ls`. You should see a directory called `mario`.
8. Execute `cd mario` to change into that directory.
9. Execute `ls`. You should see this problem’s distribution code, including `sketch.js`, `index.html` and `style.css`.
10. You can find additional graphics for customizing your game later, [here](https://github.com/games50/mario/tree/master/mario/graphics).
12. Your now ready to start working on your game!
13. Follow the Live Server documentation to preview your application.

## Specification
