# Problem: Mario

## tl;dr
Build a Super Mario type platformer game.

## Preview
Once the game is complete, it could look something like this. The game map is totally customizable and yours will most likely look quite a bit different.



<style type="text/css">
.iframe_container {
	position: relative;
	padding-bottom: 56.25%; 
	padding-top: 25px;
	height: 0;
	margin-bottom: 30px;
}

.iframe_container iframe {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}
</style>

## What to Do
This problem will take several steps to complete. The videos below will guide you through this. I will, of course, be available as well to help explain and troubleshoot.

#### Part 1 
	1. Creating the `generateTiles()` function
	2. Creating the `Sprite` class
	3. Creating the game map using a csv file

Note: This video assumes you know something about JavaScript objects and arrays. The [mini-lesson linked here](https://cs50nestm.github.io/web/objects-and-arrays/) explains these concepts.

#### Part 2
	4. Creating the alien player sprite
	5. Preparing to animate the alien sprite
<!-- 	5. Animating and controling the alien sprite
	6. Addition gravity and collision checking -->

#### Still TODO
	7. Adding gravity
	8. Resolving platform collisions
	9. Adding scrolling
	10. Adding enemies
	11. Finishing touches: adding score and sound effects

## Getting Started
I highly recommend dowloading [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer&ssr=false#overview) installed on your own computer to develop and test your code.

1. Download this problem’s "distribution code" (i.e., starter code) onto your computer. Copy and paste `https://github.com/cs50nestm/web/raw/master/mario/mario.zip` into the address bar of your web browser to download a (compressed) ZIP file. 
2. Drag this zip file into a folder where you will develop your application, then open that folder in VS Studio.
5. Execute `unzip mario.zip` in the terminal you will have access to in VS Studio.
6. Execute `rm mario.zip` followed by `yes` or `y` to delete that ZIP file.
7. Execute `ls`. You should see a directory called `mario`, which was inside of that ZIP file.
8. Execute `cd mario` to change into that directory.
9. Execute `ls`. You should see this problem’s distribution code, including `sketch.js`, `index.html` and `style.css`.
10. Start coding!
11. Follow the Live Server documentation to preview your application.

## Specification

1. Create the game, as per the videos, and add one personal feature, to make it your own.
