# Pong

The goal of this project is to create Pong, one of the earliest 2-D archade games, originally released by Atari back in 1972. Your job is to recreate Pong 
either on your own, or as a code-a-long with the videos. You may then totally customize it to make it your own.

<style type="text/css">
.iframe_container {
	position: relative;
	padding-bottom: 56.25%; 
	padding-top: 25px;
	height: 0;
	margin-bottom: 30px;
}

.iframe_container iframe {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}
</style>

## What to Do

This problem will take several steps to complete. The videos below will guide you through this. I will, of course, be available as well to help explain and troubleshoot.

#### Part 1
```
1. Review the distribution code
2. Create the puck and two paddles
3. Create functions to move the ball, bounce the ball off the top and bottom, and increase the score if the ball goes past the paddles
4. Create the functions to move the paddles, make sure the paddles stay on the canvas

## Getting Started

You can start by copying one of the folders you've used before for a prior p5 project, or download the starter folder as outlined here.

1. Execute `cd` to ensure that youâ€™re in ~/ (i.e., your home directory, aka ~).
2. Execute `wget https://github.com/cs50nestm/web/raw/master/pong/pong.zip` to download a (compressed) ZIP file with the p5 starter files.
1. Execute `unzip pong.zip` to uncompress that file.
1. Execute ls. You should see a directory called `pong`, which was inside of that ZIP file.
1. Execute `cd pong` to change into that directory.
1. Execute ls. You should see the p5 starter code, including index.html, style.css and sketch.js

## Specification
