# Writing Assignment: Computer Simulation

## tl;dr

Learn about computer simulation and how it can be used to predict the spread of viruses.

In about 600 words, discuss how computer simulation can help us analyze how viruses spread, what we can do to slow them down, and how we can model real-world situations using your knowledge of programming.

## Step 1: Take a Look at this Virus Simulation

Take a look at this example of the [exponential growth of viruses](https://intro.cs50nestm.net/virus). This animation was inspired by Mr. Sullivan, who teaches computer science to NEST+m middle schoolers, who was in turn inspired by an article in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/).

## Step 2: Do Some Reasearch

Read a few articles about computer simulation. A good starting point might be the Washington Post article linked above. Make sure to save the links to these articles to use as citations later on.

## Step 3: Write an Essay in a Google Doc

In approximately 600 words, discuss how computer simulation can help us predict the spread of viruses, like covid-19, as well as model other real world situations. In your written response, you should consider this (non-exhaustive) list of questions a good starting point:

* What is computer modeling and simulation?
* How does the Virus Simulator, as seen above, model the concept of "flattening the curve"?
* What do the different color dots in the virus simulator represent?
* Do you get the same Virus Simulator graph everytime, without changing any parameters? Why do you think that is?
* What does this simulator suggest you can do to slow down the spread of a virus?
* Why do we use computer simulation and modeling?
* What are some other commonly used applications of modeling?

Please make sure to include at least three citations. Be sure to include for each the name of the article read, name of the website or publication where you found the article, date the article was written, author’s name, and URL, if found online.

## Step 4: Submit

For this assignment, you will submit through google classroom. The assignment you will submit this essay for is called "Computer Simulation Writing Assignment".
